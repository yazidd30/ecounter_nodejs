Deskripsi:

Although our common sense can normally guide us on what to do when it comes to taking care of ourselves, often we don't pay attention to our inner wisdom, or even worse, does the opposite to what it tells us. For example, we know that eating healthy, doing physical exercises and making sure we get proper rest are essential to our well-being. However, habit, convenience or just sheer lack of discipline often lead us on the wrong path. And we pay attention to where we're heading, only when illnesses and diseases overtake us.
